- [x] BUG: The horizontal separators don't fill the entire board width on certain screen dimensions
  - ✅ FIXED: Moved horizontal separator outside column loop to span full board width
  - ✅ TESTED: Verified fix works across 8 different screen dimensions (mobile to desktop)
  - ✅ IMPLEMENTATION: Changed from percentage-based positioning to absolute positioning with width: 100%
- [ ] UI: Remove the hole from the bead
- [ ] Make the beads closer to adjacent beads on the left and right. The current spacing is too wide.
- [ ] Change the favicon to represent sempoa
