- [x] SP-001: [BUG] The horizontal separators don't fill the entire board width on certain screen dimensions
- [x] SP-002: [UI] Convert ring-shaped beads to solid circles for authentic abacus appearance
- [x] SP-003: [UI] Reduce horizontal spacing between columns to make beads closer to adjacent beads
- [x] SP-004: [UI] Align column header labels with beads and optimize large number display in limited space
- [ ] SP-005: [AUTH] Implement local storage-based authentication system for user sessions
- [x] SP-006: [FEATURE] Extend sempoa board to support 13-digit calculations (up to trillions)
- [x] SP-007: [FEATURE] Create learning journey progression system with sidebar UI (medium-sized icons) following spec.md leveling structure, replacing current Game Control section
- [ ] SP-008: [FEATURE] Add question timer to track and store completion time for each problem in local storage
- [ ] SP-009: [GAMIFICATION] Create SVG cat illustration with connect-the-dots reveal mechanism - dots/lines progressively appear with each correct answer (supporting curved paths)
- [ ] SP-010: [FEATURE] Enable swipe gestures for bead manipulation on tablets and mobile devices
- [x] SP-011: [UX] Implement ergonomic question layout - position questions at top-right of sempoa board on desktop, above board on mobile. Configure sempoa board to display only 9 columns for better mobile experience
- [ ] SP-012: [RESPONSIVE] Create tablet-friendly layout optimization for all components with appropriate spacing and touch targets
- [x] SP-013: [UX] Implement visual feedback for answer correctness by changing the background color of the question container in addition to the existing Check Answer button feedback
- [x] SP-014: [INPUT] Implement keyboard input for answers with automatic sempoa bead positioning to match typed numbers
- [x] SP-015: [UI] Add visual progress indicators showing completion percentage in both Progress section and Learning Journey sidebar - implemented blue progress bars for main progress and operations, green progress bars for complement sections with smooth animations and proper accessibility (role="progressbar", ARIA attributes)
- [ ] SP-016: [ALGORITHM] Improve question generation algorithm to avoid zero values in operands unless no other valid options exist
- [x] SP-017: [AUDIO] Add voice feedback when beads are moved to provide auditory confirmation of bead interactions
- [x] SP-018: [AUDIO] Add audio feedback for answer correctness with happy/sad sounds - implemented ascending major chord melody for correct answers and descending minor sequence for incorrect answers, integrated with useAnswerChecking hook
