Create an interactive sempoa/abacus learning application. The app should display a sempoa board where users can manipulate beads. It will feature multiple difficulty levels, starting from beginner level. The focus will be exclusively on addition and subtraction operations. The levels include:

# Sempoa Mechanics

Users can move beads by clicking and dragging them to the desired position on the board. The app will provide visual feedback to indicate valid moves.

On touch devices, users can also use gestures to manipulate the beads.

# Question Types

**Addition**

- Without complementary numbers (small friend or big friend)
- Using small friend only
- Using big friend only
- Using both small and big friends

Each level includes sub-categories:

- Single digit numbers
- Double digit numbers
- Triple digit numbers

**Subtraction**

The same structure as addition but for subtraction operations.

**Mixed Operations**

The same structure as above but combining addition and subtraction operations.
