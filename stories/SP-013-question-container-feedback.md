# SP-013: Question Container Visual Feedback

## Overview
Enhance user experience by adding visual feedback to the question container background when answers are checked, complementing the existing Check Answer button feedback.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-1**: Question container background changes color when answer is checked
- **FR-2**: Use same colors as Check Answer button (green for correct, red for incorrect)
- **FR-3**: Background color change is temporary with smooth transition animation
- **FR-4**: Background returns to normal state after feedback period
- **FR-5**: Feedback works consistently across desktop and mobile layouts

### Technical Requirements
- **TR-1**: Implement using Framer Motion animations for smooth color changes
- **TR-2**: Integrate with existing answer checking logic in useAnswerChecking hook
- **TR-3**: Maintain consistent color scheme with existing UI components
- **TR-4**: Ensure accessibility with sufficient color contrast

### User Experience
- **UX-1**: Provides immediate visual confirmation of answer correctness
- **UX-2**: Enhances feedback clarity without disrupting user flow
- **UX-3**: Complements existing button feedback rather than replacing it

## Implementation Notes
- Leverage existing answer checking state management
- Apply feedback to QuestionDisplay component container
- Use Framer Motion's `animate` prop for background color changes
- Use Tailwind CSS classes for consistent styling
- Implement timeout mechanism for temporary feedback

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Question container background changes color on answer check
- [ ] Colors match existing Check Answer button feedback
- [ ] Smooth transition animation between states
- [ ] Background returns to normal after appropriate duration
- [ ] Feedback works on both desktop and mobile layouts
