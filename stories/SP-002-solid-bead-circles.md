# SP-002: Convert Ring-Shaped Beads to Solid Circles

## Problem Statement
Currently, sempoa beads appear as rings (circles with holes in the center), which differs from traditional abacus beads that are solid pieces.

## Solution
Convert the bead visual design from ring-shaped to solid circular beads to provide a more authentic abacus appearance.

## Technical Requirements
- Maintain current bead dimensions and positioning
- Preserve all existing interactions (click, drag, touch)
- Ensure visual consistency across active/inactive states
- Update CSS styling to remove border-only styling

## Success Criteria
- Beads appear as solid circles without holes
- No regression in bead functionality
- Visual consistency maintained across all screen sizes

## Implementation Approach
Modify the DraggableBead component CSS to use solid background color instead of border-only styling.
