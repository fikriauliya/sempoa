# SP-008: Question Timer with Historical Tracking

## Overview
Add a timer feature that tracks completion time for each math problem and displays historical performance data to help users monitor their solving speed progress.

## Requirements

### Core Functionality
- Timer starts automatically when a new question is displayed
- Timer continues running until the correct answer is submitted (ignores wrong answers)
- Completion time is stored in local storage when question is answered correctly
- Timer resets for each new question

### Display Requirements
- Timer format: "MM:SS" (e.g., "00:15", "01:30")
- Show current timer prominently during question solving
- Display historical completion times list/summary
- Historical data persists between sessions via local storage

### Data Storage
- Store completion times with question metadata (operands, operation type, difficulty)
- Maintain chronological order of completion times
- Use local storage for persistence across browser sessions

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Timer displays in MM:SS format and updates every second
- [ ] Timer starts when new question appears
- [ ] Timer stops and records time only on correct answers
- [ ] Completion times are stored in local storage
- [ ] Historical times are displayed to user
- [ ] Timer continues running during incorrect attempts
- [ ] Data persists between browser sessions

## Technical Implementation
- Extend GameContext to include timer state
- Add timer display component to UI
- Implement local storage utilities for time tracking
- Create historical times display component
