# SP-004: Column Header Alignment and Large Number Display

## Problem Statement
The column header labels showing place values (1,000,000, 100,000, etc.) are not properly aligned with the beads below them. Additionally, large numbers don't fit well in the limited space above each column.

## Technical Requirements
1. **Alignment**: Headers must be precisely centered above their corresponding bead columns
2. **Space Optimization**: Large numbers (1,000,000+) need creative display solutions
3. **Responsive Design**: Must work across different screen sizes
4. **Visual Consistency**: All headers should have uniform styling and spacing

## Proposed Solution
1. **Abbreviated Notation**: Use short forms (1M, 100K, 10K, 1K, 100, 10, 1)
2. **CSS Grid/Flexbox**: Implement precise alignment with board columns
3. **Responsive Typography**: Scale font size based on available space
4. **Visual Hierarchy**: Ensure headers don't interfere with bead interactions

## Implementation Plan
1. Locate current header implementation in SempoaBoard component
2. Create mapping for place value abbreviations
3. Implement CSS alignment system matching bead column structure
4. Add responsive font sizing
5. Test alignment across different screen sizes

## Success Criteria
- Headers are visually centered above each bead column
- Large numbers are readable and fit within allocated space
- Layout remains consistent across screen sizes
- No interference with bead interaction areas
