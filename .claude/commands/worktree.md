- For each uncompleted task in @TODOS.md, if not yet created:
  - Create a corresponding branch in the format <ticket-id>-task-name (don't checkout). Use lower cases for the branch name
  - Create a git worktree for each branch, put it on ../<branch-name>
  - Use single git command: `git worktree add` for the tasks above
- If it has been created, merge the latest changes from the main branch into the worktree.
