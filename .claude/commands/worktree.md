- For each uncompleted task in @TODOS.md
- Please first check whether the branch exists (`git branch` then match the ticket ID).
- Only for uncreated branches, create a corresponding branch using the format `<ticket-id>-task-name` (don't checkout). Use lowercase for the branch name.
  - Create a git worktree for each branch and place it in `../<branch-name>`
  - Use the single git command: `git worktree add` for the above tasks
- If the worktree already exists, merge the latest changes from the main branch into it. Don't `cd` there, but use `git -C`
- If `.env` doesn't exist, create one with an available unique port for the HTTP server
- Each branch should have a different VITE_PORT in its .env file
